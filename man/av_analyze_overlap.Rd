\title{Analyze Top-Hit Overlap}
\usage{
av_analyze_overlap(
  comparison_result,
  top_percentile = 0.05,
  high_is_good = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{comparison_result}{The list output from \code{av_compare_scores}.}

\item{top_percentile}{Numeric. Cutoff for top hits (e.g., 0.01 for top 1\%).}

\item{high_is_good}{Logical. If TRUE, high scores are top hits. If FALSE (e.g. p-values), low scores are top.}
}
\value{
A list with the confusion matrix and overlap counts.
}
\description{
Calculates the overlap of the top X\% variants between AlphaGenome and external scores.
Useful for checking if the model prioritizes similar variants ("Venn Diagram logic").
